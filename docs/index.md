# 📄 **README — Pipeline de Interação miRNA–UTR** ![](reference/figures/logo_miRHeat.png)

## 🧬 **Overview**

This repository contains a complete pipeline for analyzing miRNA–UTR
interactions from block-formatted files. The workflow includes file
parsing, data standardization, application of numeric filters,
construction of a miRNA × UTR matrix, and automated heatmap generation
with cluster detection based on dendrograms.

This package was developed to support bioinformatics and/or biomedical
researchers in handling results generated by miRNA–gene interaction
prediction programs. Its goal is to be easy to use, accommodating both
early-career researchers and experienced professionals, while
facilitating the screening of biologically relevant interactions and the
visualization of binding patterns.

The package is open to suggestions for improvement and constructive
feedback.

## 🚀 **Main Features**

- **Reading and parsing** interaction files (`parse_file`)
- **Score selection** for downstream analysis (`select_score`)
- **Custom numeric filters** for minimum energy/score thresholds
  (`apply_numeric_filters`)
- **Data preparation** for heatmap generation (`prepare_for_heatmap`)
- **miRNA × UTR matrix generation**
- **Fully automated heatmap**, including:
  - hierarchical clustering
  - automatic detection of the optimal number of clusters via
    dendrograms (`dynamicTreeCut`)
- Informative messages throughout the entire process

## 📦 **Dependencies**

Install the following packages before running the pipeline:

``` r
install.packages(c(
  "tidyverse",
  "reshape2",
  "pheatmap",
  "dynamicTreeCut"
))
```

## 🛠️ \*How to Use the Pipeline\*\*

### 1. Load the main script

``` r
source("pipeline_mirna_utr.R")
```

### 2. Run the basic workflow

``` r
df <- parse_file("exemplo_blocos.txt")
df <- select_score(df, score_column = "interaction_energy")
df <- apply_numeric_filters(df, min_value = -8)
df <- prepare_for_heatmap(df)

plot_mirheat(df)
```

The heatmap will be displayed automatically, with the number of clusters
dynamically detected.

## 📊 **Output Example**

- Normalized miRNA × UTR matrix
- Colored heatmap with dendrograms
- Automatic cluster assignment

## 📁 **Recommended Repository Structure**

    /mirna-utr-pipeline
     ├─ pipeline_mirna_utr.R
     ├─ exemplo_blocos.txt
     ├─ outputs/
     │    ├─ heatmap.png (opcional)
     │    └─ matriz_mirna_utr.csv
     ├─ README.md
     └─ LICENSE (opcional)

## 🔍 **Important Notes**

- The pipeline assumes that the `utr` column contains only the UTR
  number.
- The clustering method is fully automatic but can be manually adjusted
  if needed.
- The pipeline performs best with moderate-sized datasets (hundreds to
  thousands of interactions).
