Description: The miRHeat package provides functions to process and visualize miRNA–UTR 
    interaction predictions. It includes tools to filter RNAhybrid or IntaRNA 
    output files based on interaction energy thresholds and seed pairing criteria,
    and to convert filtered results into tidy data frames and heatmaps for 
    comparative visualization.
